                    <p> My Aunt and Uncle only lived close to me for a short period of time while I was in 
                     elementary school. One thing I remember discretely from this time was going 
                     over their house while my parents went out.  
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                      For dinner my Aunt Tara made
                      mac and cheese and brussel sprouts.  I scarfed down the mac and cheese
                      but once I got to the brussel sprouts they were not appealing to me. I refused to eat them and 
                      this is when I learned that Uncle Marty just like Aunt Tara would not concede to  
                      my stubbornness. I sat their all night looking at those brussel sprouts until I eventually 
                      admitted defeat and ate those tasteless vegetables.

                    <p> Living in Northeastern Pennsylvania made it very difficult to visit
                     my family in Arizona but my family and I tried to make it a habit of
                    visting them during summer break. One summer, when I was still in Middle School,
                    we came down and we just spent our time relaxing at their beautiful house. 
                    During this time Uncle Marty enjoyed playing around with us and having a  
                    Good time. I remember him pushing us into the pool and throwing a nerf football 
                    into the pool so we could make a game winning catch into the water.  My Mom who 
                    liked to lay by the pool also got a nice surprise when Uncle Marty turned on the 
                    sprinklers while she was tanning.</p>

                    <p> Even though I was only able to visit them seldomly in Arizona, I was able
                      to learn many important lessons from him when I was there. He taught me that you
                      get what you deserve when he tapped my brother and cousin together for tapping 
                      our younger cousin to a chair.  He showed me that family and friends are very valuable
                      by letting me play with his buddies in poker night even though I wasn't very good.
                      Lastly he taught me that you can disagree with a lot of people and they can say things about
                      you behind your back, but their view doesn't describe you. It doesn't define you as a friend, 
                      a father, a uncle, a husband, or even a son.  </p>
